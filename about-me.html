    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="Values and Beliefs">
        <h2>Values and Beliefs</h2>
        <p>My hero is Dr. Jordan Peterson.</p>
        <p>Listening to Peterson and acting upon his ideas has lead me to consciously choose to believe that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Life is suffering.</li>
            <li>Suffering presents an opportunity to have meaning in life by bearing the heaviest burden that I can bear.</li>
            <li>Happiness, as a neurochemical state, is ephemeral, and it is unwise to seek it out as a permanent state.</li>
            <li>By contrast, meaning is something achievable on a moment-by-moment basis, as long as I choose to--in the words of Alcoholic Anonymous:
              <ul>
                <li>Accept what is out of my control with serenity.</li>
                <li>Act upon what I can control with courage.</li>
                <li>Cultivate the wisdom of differentiating between the two.</li>
              </ul></li>
            <li>Unless, I develop and use my capacity for truth, then I stand no chance of living up to the above. That is why, it is important for me to <em>"Tell the truth ... or at least don't lie."</em> </li>
            <li>Telling the truth is a discipline and it must be exercised each day.</li>
            <li>Discipline is not a matter of sprinting, but a matter of building microhabits that allow me to reduce the cognitive burden of working on what I consider meaningful.</li>
            <li>By developing this discipline, I gain a key to fulfillment, to paraphrase George Leonard.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Values</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Home is wherever I am.</li>
            <li>Family is who I choose.</li>
            <li>Giving is receiving.</li>
            <li>Curiosity and learning are important.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Family</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Bubby and Grandpa</li>
            <li>Navdeep Maini</li>
            <li>Shawn Pan</li>
