# What to Learn First in Web Development

Jeremy Onion Interview on _How to Code Well_ Podcast.

- New developers should learn the language _prior_ to learning the framework, so that
  - they know what the framework is doing,
  - are better prepared for when stuff breaks, that is, they'll be better equipped to
    - identify where the bug is happening
    - research how to fix the bug
    - fix the issue
  - they're more flexible when a framework inevitably wanes in popularity,
    - so that they can transition into another project/remain current
