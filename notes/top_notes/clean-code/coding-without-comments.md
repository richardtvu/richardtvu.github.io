> You should always write your code as if comments didn't exist

## Why should you write your code as if comments didn't exist?

- Approaching code with that in mind _forces_ you to write code in the simplest, plainest, most self-documenting way you can do

- Comments are meant to communicate with other people, so for them to be good, you have to write well. Most coders aren't practiced writers and neither are you ... unless you are, but even then, focus on your strengths and make that code better.

- Code that requires comments to understand is more likely to be **bad** than necessarily needing comments

## When should comments come into play?

- After you've exhausted possibilities for rewriting, refactoring, rearchitect-ing code

## What is the key difference between junior and senior developers?

- **Seniors** focus on making the code clear and understandable enough to tell the story of what a program is supposed to do.
- **Juniors** rely on comments as a cruch to tell the story.

## Summary

- Excessive comments are the lazy way of making code understandable. More often, the code itself is just bad and should be refactored, rewritten, or rearchitect-ed. Simple, clear, self-documenting code is the mark of a senior developer. By contrast, the mark of a junior developer is a reliance on comments as a crutch to explain their code. 
- The purpose of comments is to communicate with human beings, but most people who got into coding are horrible writers (including me). Thus, focus on the strength of writing good code that will do a better job of communicating.
