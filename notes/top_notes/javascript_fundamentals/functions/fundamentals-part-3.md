### Practice 

Write some functions in the `script` tag of a skeleton HTML file and test the output with `console.log`: 
1. Write a function called `add7` that takes a number and returns that number + 7. 
2. Write a function called `multiply` that takes 2 numbers and returns their product. 
3. Write a function called `capitalize` that takes a string and returns that string with *only* the first letter capitalized. Make sure that it can take strings that are lowercase, UPPERCASE, or BoTh. 
4. Write a function called `lastLetter` that takes a string and returns the very last letter of that string: 
    1. `lastLetter("abcd") should return "d"
