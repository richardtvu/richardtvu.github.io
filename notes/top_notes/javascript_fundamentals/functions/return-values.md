# [Function return values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Return_values)

## Learning Objectives

- What do you need to understand about function return values?
- How do you make use of function return values?

### What are return values? 
- **Return values** are the outputs of functions that can be stored into variables, used by other functions as parameters, etc. They are values output by functions. 
    -  Not all functions return values. Instead, they return `void` or `undefined`. 
        - e.g. `displayMessage()`
- Functions with return values are generally used as intermediate steps in calculations. 

### How do you use return values in your own functions? 
- Include `return` followed by the variable/value/expression to be returned in the fucntion definition. 

### Active learning: Creating our own return value function? 
- What did you do in this active learning exercise? 
- What did you learn from the exercise? 

### Exploration time: Creating some functions of your own and adding them to the library
- How do you get the square or cube root of the number? 
- How do you get the circumference of a circle with a given radius? 
- Can you write some *error handling* into the functions to check that the parameters are validated and that optional parameters have some kind of default value? 
- What kind of functions might you use over and over again, thereby warranting inclusion in your own *function library*?
