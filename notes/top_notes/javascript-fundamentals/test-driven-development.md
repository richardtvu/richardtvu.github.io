- What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?

  - It's a software development process that involves writing tests to define what your code will do. When you write the tests beforehand, you know when you've successfully written your program: It will past your tests.

- Why is TDD more productive than writing code without tests?

  - By writing the tests beforehand, you know exactly what your program has to do to be considered successful: It needs to pass the tests. Writing these tests beforehand let you automate the process of checking that your code is doing what it's supposed to do, instead of having to manually check the code each time you make changes.

- Exercises:

  - helloWorld - done
  - repeatString - done

    - I learned that you can pass in parameters to the function by declaring the variables within the parentheses. For instance, 

      ```javascript
      const repeatString = function(baseString, reps) {
            // statements
        }
      ```

  - reverseString - done 
    - I was able to reverse the string by using a for loop with a decrementing i and the `.charAt(index)` method. 
    
  - removeFromArray
  - sumAll
  - leapYears
  - tempConversion
