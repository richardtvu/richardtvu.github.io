# WOOP March 31, 2020

WISH: I wish to complete 3 sets of Javascript practice today. Specifically, I want to do the tasks in the [Loops](https://javascript.info/while-for) page and if I have time, finish the [Test Driven Development practice](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/fundamentals-part-4#loops).

OUTCOME: I will feel accomplished and disciplined, also committed and feel ike I have a reason to congratulate myself. Plus, my list of things to be proud of will increase by 1!

OBSTACLE: The main inner obstacle I face is the desire to stop working on the studying when it gets hard. When things get hard and I feel tired, I feel like I'd much rather just stop what I'm doing and call it a day. I'd much rather read web novels instead.

PLAN: IF I feel like the studying is too hard and want to do something else, THEN I will keep studying until the end of the pomodoro and treat myself to 5 minutes of web novels afterwards.

Results:

- I learned that the prefix and postfix operators `++` work differently. The prefix `++`, e.g. `++i`, first adds increments `i` and then returns that value. Thus, if `i` is 4, then `++i<5` would be treated as `5<5`, which would be `false`. By comparison, _postfix_ `++`, e.g. `i++`, increments `i` but returns the old value of `i`. Thus, if `i` is 4, then `i++<5` will be treated as `4<5`, which would be `true`.
- I was able to write a program that finds the primes between 2 and a number n.

Next steps:

- Complete the following exercises:

  ```
  helloWorld
  repeatString
  reverseString
  removeFromArray
  sumAll
  leapYears
  tempConversio
  ```
