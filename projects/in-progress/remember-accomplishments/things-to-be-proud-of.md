# Things to be proud of

- The purpose of this document is to record things that I've enjoyed doing or feel proud of; to record what I've gotten out of my journey in studying Computer Science; and to express anything else that will help remind me of the good in my life.

## Here are some accomplishments or other things I've liked about my journey:

- Coming up with the idea to make this document! This document arose as response to my fear that I'd put in a lot of hard work to study computer science only to waste my time and get rejected from jobs. To tackle that fear, which will likely come up in my deepest lows again and again, I wanted a way to remind myself that I have indeed gotten something out of studying and that I haven't wasted my time! 
- I was able to pass Antra's tech interview and get an offer, which is my first tech offer. God bless Rohit.
