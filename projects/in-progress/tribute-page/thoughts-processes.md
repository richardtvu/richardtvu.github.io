Tribute to Jordan Peterson
===

## What inspired me to start this project? 
I was listening to the Daily Software Engineer (or a podcast with a similar name) where Quincy Larson laid out his vision for what he wanted freeCodeCamp to be in the future. This listen sparked a desire to check out freeCodeCamp (FCC) and do one of the projects. I chose the Tribute Page project. Then, I thought about my heroes and the one that was above all the rest is Dr. Jordan Peterson. 

I started listening to Dr. Jordan Peterson around Winter 2016 (give or take a year) in my senior year at Swarthmore College.
