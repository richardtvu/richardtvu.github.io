                        “To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life,
                        with
                        eyes
                        wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities
                        of
                        habitable
                        order. It means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, and accepting the end of
                        the
                        unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are only dimly comprehended. It
                        means
                        willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a productive and meaningful reality
                        (it
                        means
                        acting to please God, in the ancient language).”
