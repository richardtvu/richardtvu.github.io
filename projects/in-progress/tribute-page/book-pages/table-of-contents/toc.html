                “To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes
                wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable
                order. It means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, and accepting the end of the
                unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are only dimly comprehended. It means
                willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a productive and meaningful reality (it means
                acting to please God, in the ancient language).”
