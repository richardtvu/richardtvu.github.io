# WOOP 8.2.3 Invariants Notes 

- **WISH**: I wish to study Java for an hour, two pomodoros.
- **OUTCOME**: I would understand what invariants are and be able to explain the basics of robust handling of errors using Java. I would also feel accomplished and proud that I was able to overcome some anxiety of mine toward doing some studying.
- **OBSTACLE**: I feel anxious about studying and don't want to do it. I feel as if I am not a good student since I don't immediately get it and it takes a lot of thinking to start to get it. I feel like I'm going to expose myself as a bad student if I try. 
- **PLANNING**: If I feel anxious and worried about being a bad student, then I will remind myself that to become good at something, you must first be bad at it.
