**WISH**: I wish to do **FOUR** sets of Java today: One this morning, one at 6:00 PM during unscheduled time, and two after I get back home.Specifically, I want to write pseudocode for each exercise in chapter 3. Then, I want to write actual code for the problems that I can, write out questions for me to answer during the text readings/guide my readings, and then come back to the exercises after the readings/after I get some reading done. 

**OUTCOME**: The ideal outcome of doing four sets of Java is that I'd feel disciplined and purposeful for making it a priority to learn, even when I have overtime and other things taking up my attention. My back would straighter. My chest more open. My focus more clear. 

**OBSTACLE**: Tiredness and fatigue. The main inner obstacle that I face is the sense of fatigue that will build up as my sleep deficit catches up to me, in particular that sense of feeling overwhelmed, anxious in my sternum, fraught with thoughts about paying the huge electricity bill, the bitterness I feel about being slammed with the bill, the desire for me to go to sleep, to go read, or to go jack off, and the like. 

**PLANNING**: IF I feel fatigue, THEN I will tell myself that even when I am tired, I can still study and that the exertion will help me sleep more restfully. 

**RESULTS**: 
- Wrote pseudocode for exercise 3.6.
- Began thinking through exercise 3.7.
