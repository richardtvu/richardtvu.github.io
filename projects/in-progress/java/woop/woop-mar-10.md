# WOOP March 10, 2020

Wish: I wish to study Java for 3 pomodoros. Specifically, I want to complete chapter 2.6 and potentially 2.7. 

Outcome: The ideal outcome of completing chapter 2.6 and 2.7 would be that I'd be comfortable using JavaFx on the command line and using Eclipse! I'd feel disciplined for having chosen to study when I had initially started off wanting to jack ocff. Instead, I meditated and then reminded myself to WOOP. My back would be straighter and my core engaged. I'd feel the clicks of my fingers and be in tune with my computer, in flow. 

Obstacle: The main inner obstacle preventing me from studying jAva for 3 pomodoros is my tendency to get distracted by other things, such as my seeing double of the screen in my left eye... but not my right eye, which is distracting. I'm not sure, why I'm seeing double, but it could definitely draw my attention into rumination and worry about my eye health and all of that.

Planning: If I worry and get distracted by my double vision, then I will acknowledge my distraction and then speak out loud what I am planning to do to stay on track/to do next. 


Result: I ended up accidentally deleting my eclipse installer and my eclipse folder. Time to redownload it... I'm still stuck on the part about moving the jdk folders and jfx folders to the bin. 
- Reinstalled Java Eclipse 
    - `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64(Current)`
    -`/home/richardtvu/eclipse/java`
- I tried to go back and do the command line stuff and tried to make an alias. Did not work, so I went back to eclipse. I added the openjdk I installed, `/home/richardtvu/eclipse/jdk-13.0.2` and included the command `-p /home/richardtvu/eclipse/javafx-sdk-13.0.2/lib --add-modules=ALL-MODULE-PATH`. I then added the external jars by navigating to the lib section of javafx and adding each one of the .jar files. I'm finally able to use an outside jdk! Hurray! I was able to run HelloWorld.java on the new project!

**I finished the entirety of chapter 2 readings**. Now I'm starting the programming exercises. I was able to do exercise 2.1

**Next step, continue with exercise 2.2**. Next wish? Do one or two exercises per pomodoro, for 3-6 exercises total tomorrow
