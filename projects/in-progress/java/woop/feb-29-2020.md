# WOOP Provably Correct Programs

- **WISH**: I wish to study Java for two pomodoros (including this WOOPING session, 2 sets of 25 minutes)
- **Outcome**: Feel disciplined and hopeful. 
    - Ideally, I'd feel excited about what I'm learning and excited that I am practicing the skill of goal-setting and following through, of breaking down a larger goal into smaller goals that are more realistically accomplished and provide a sense of direction to what I'm doing. After the study session, I hope to be more learned about writing correct programs, be able to explain what a provably correct program is, how pre and post conditions relate to it, in addition to what invariant elements of loops are. 
- **Obstacles**: Feeling overwhelmed and anxious about reading the Java textbook. 
    - A lot of of the time, I scroll down the chapter and see that it's super lonb and takes a while to get to the bottom. my eyes begin to glaze over as I skim through the text and think "Man, I don't understand this." And start to feel overwhelemed and start to doubt whether I'll be able to understand this. I feel fear of being stupid and don't want to subject myself to whta feels like torture. Thus, the main obstacle is feeling overwhelmed and stupid because I don't immediately understand the material. 
- **Planning** IF I feel overwhelmed and stupid, THEN I will slow down and determine a small next step I can take to improve my understanding of the material.
