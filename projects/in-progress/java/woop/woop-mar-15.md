# WOOP March 15, 2020 

## WOOP #2 of the day
Wish: I wish to complete four more pomodoros today, one this afternoon, and three in the evening. 

Outcome: I will feel disciplined that I was able to continue in the afternoon and complete 1.5 hours even though I felt frustrated by the end of pomodoro #2. I will also feel invigorated to be back and doing something where I am getting positive feedback woohoo! 

Obstacle: Since I'm already in a frustrated mode, I might just want to figuratively flip the table and just be fuck this shit I don't want to do it. 

Planning: IF I feel like flipping the table, THEN I'll tell myself, just keep it up until the end of this afternoon pomodoro so I can go to take a nap and then head out to the gym and I'll be fine in the evening! 

## WOOP #1 of the day 
Wish: I wish to complete one pomodoro of project Euler, including the time it takes to write this WOOP. 

Outcome: I will feel courageous for facing my fear of solving hard problems and getting stumped! I will feel disciplined for committing to sit down to do the project euler stuff and also satisfied that I was able to apply my stress is good mindset, growth mindset! 

Obstacles: Solving problems is a bitch when I don't feel like I've seen them before and feel uncomfortable. I could feel myself thinking "MAN This is hard. I don't know how I'm supposed to get this. And nobody is going to help me ugh, why don't I just go back to doing textbook shit and bwork on my foundation first? 

Planning: IF I feel uncomfortable, THEN I will tell myself that the discomfort is part of growing and I've committed to working for the rest of the 25 minutes I've alloted! 

Result: 

- Created my account for project Euler. 
- I finished the first problem! Hurray! 
- Checked the solutions overview and I am confused as FUCK by how to create this function. 
- Completed **TWO** pomodoros


```Java
int target = 1000;
int sum = 0; 

/* Create a function to check if a number is divisible */
public static int SumDivisibleBy(n) {
    int number = 0; 
    int total; 
    // let's say that n = 3 
    while ( number < target) {
        if ( number % n ) {
            total += number;
        }    
    }
    number ++; 
    return total; 
}

```
... I'm still stuck on understanding the div shit and why the function has to be a certain way, but I can come back to that.
