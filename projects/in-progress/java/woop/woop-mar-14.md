It's PI day, so it's pizza day!

Wish: I wish to do 6 sets of Java today, with the aim of completing my review of the Chapter 2 programming exercises; re-answering and reviewing the answers to Quiz 2; and then getting started on Chapter 3\. I expect to take about 3 pomodoros to complete chapter 2\. Then, I'll head to the quiz on Chapter 3 to take it, figure out what I'm unclear on, which will guide my reading. In addition to that, I'll look at the programming exercises, attempt to do them, and then write down any questions needed to answer them. I expect to at least finish the quiz on the chapter, though trying out the programming exercises may require more than the remaining 3 sets of Java.

Outcome: The ideal outcome of completing the above is that I'd feel productive, in terms of only working on things that I've an unclear grasp on and therefore working on the things that will help me grow and continue move through the book effectively. In doing so, I'd feel on track and more motivated to continue learning because I'd have a reasonable chance of getting to Chapter 8 in the textbook where my next course will start off, meaning that I'd be caught up to date! The ideal outcome of doing these things is that I'd feel accomplished and experienced in Java basics/familiarity, and get to write down in my log or something that I've completed the book (eventually!). I'd feel strong, with my shoulders back and down, my chest out, and proud.

Obstacle: The main inner obstacles to me doing 6 sets of Java is the sense of "No fucking way am I going to do 3 whole hours of studying!" response that I get. In particular, my inner critic and lazy sloth are saying, "Man, that's double what you were doing yesterday! Why are you pushing yourself so hard? Aren't you going to burn out?" Basically, the main inner obstacle is my desire to just chill out the rest of the day and curl up with a good book.

Planning: IF I feel resistant to the idea of studying for 6 sets, THEN I will remind myself that I have an entire day to fill and will be reading a novel for at least 2-3 hours on my walks and in the evening, so there's plenty of balance.

Results:

- Completed writing solution to 2.4 exercise with stdio/scanner
- Completed writing solution to 2.5 with descriptive comments
- Completed 2.6 review. One thing I've noticed is that the author groups the variable calculations together and then puts the display code later. Is that the industry standard for style?
- Complete 2.7 review.
- I completed my review of my quiz results and learned:

  - the crucial difference between syntax and semantics in programming is that syntax errors will not allow a program to run. In contrast, semantic errors will allow programs to run, but causes the program to do something other than what you wanted it to do
  - variable declaration statements create a box (allocating memory) and associating that box with a name
  - type is the set of values that a variable can hold
  - assignment statements are used to change the values of variables
  - String is the name of a class, hence why variables of type String are objects. 

- Began reading Chapter 3 Programming in the Small II: Control 
- I completed 3 sets of Java and I did end up feeling better! I talked out loud and that was energizing and that also doubles as practicing my ability to code out loud in interviews!
