WISH: I wish to study Java for two pomodoros: I wish to read Section 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 and practice the examples. 

OUTCOME: I would learn how to make a PrintSquare class and be able to create an Interest class that would utilize TextIO's built-in methods to calculate interest! I would feel satisfied that I am making steady progress toward readiness for Programming III, where I'd continue learning about Java. Plus, I'd have completed my studying one hour a day for a week goal, so I'd feel accomplished that! I'd feel disciplined and would feel a sense of relief and also energyexcitement at having ffinished it. 

OBSTACLE: The main inner obstacle of mine right now is feeling tired and thinking that I am unable to do the readdings because I'm unofcused. I would feel like there are some heavy eyelids on my eyes, drooping, with a sense of my head wanting to droop too ... to have this comfort in my eyes. 

PLANNING: IF I feel tired and unfocused, THEN I will do the readings out loud to keep myself awake. 

Result: 
- I learned how to write the PrintSquare function based off of the comments, before looking at the actual program. Hurray! I was also able to write the Interest2 class before looking at it. I learned about how you can include sentences in the printf statement, e.g. `System.out.printf("This is a sentence you can have with a %1.2f%n floating point number and a new line after the floating point number", number);`.
