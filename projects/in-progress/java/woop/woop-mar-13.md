- Wish: I wish to study Java for 1.5 hours, specifically, I want to do exercises 2.6, and 2.7 in each pomodoro, and then review the resolutions for each answer.

- Outcome: The ideal outcome of doing 3 sets of pomodoros is that I'd feel satisfied, tired, and ready to meditate and fall alseep merrily. In doing so, I'd wake up rfeeling refreshed and ready to go!

- Obstacle: The main inner obstacle to doing this is that I find it tedious to go back through my answers, check them, and then do something else! I'd rather just keep moving forward.

- Planning: IF I feel like going back and checking through my answers is tedious, THEN I will decide to do it once and try to internalize the answer before I move on.

- Results:

  - Finished writing answers for all of the exercises.
