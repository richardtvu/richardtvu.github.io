# Goal of the Day, Java Section 8.1 Notes 

Wish: Compile and run the 3N + 1 program from [Subsection 3.2.2](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c3/s2.html#control.2.2)

Outcome: Feel accomplished, studious, dedicated. 

Obstacle: I forgot how to run the program. 

Planning: If I've forgotten how to run the program, then I will go back to 3.2.2 to read the lesson and re-create the program.
