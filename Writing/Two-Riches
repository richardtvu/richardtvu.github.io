### The Two Riches
---
Inspired by a Reading of *Linchpin* (Seth Godin, 2010).

#### Resistance Rich
* Fears change
* Eats junk food when he knows that it'll make him feel worse
* Takes things too seriously
* Pushes too hard one day and crashes the next
* Dislikes risk
* Likes security and conformity, as a proxy for belonging
* Doubts self and ability to achieve goals
* Clings to his old dreams that no longer resonate with him

#### Growth Rich
* Recognizes that fulfillment in life comes from doing the hard things, not skating by on the easy things
* Accepts what he cannot control and focuses on what he can control
* Takes calculated risks
* Shows up and does his work
* Is open to change and uncertainty
* Develops a vision for himself and acts to make it come true, but lets it go when necessary
* Dreams new dreams that resonate with him and inspire him to grow
